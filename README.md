# BASIC in C

This is "hack" trying to abuse the C-preprocessor (cpp) to basically to allow us to use a variant of BASIC to program in a C program.

To compile and run:


   > ./basic

To debug and understand what's going on, watch the output of running

   > clang -E <BASIC

And you should see the resulting actual C-program being compiled.

This is just for fun, and not to be used in liue for a real BASIC interpreter/compiler.
